    st.write("""
    ValuIt began in 2020 when our founder, Alex Chen, was teaching a finance course at 
    a local university. He noticed that students struggled with valuation concepts not 
    because they were incapable, but because the tools and resources were needlessly 
    complex and expensive.
    
    After a particularly frustrating session trying to explain DCF models using 
    traditional spreadsheets, Alex decided there had to be a better way. He teamed up 
    with Maya and Darius to create a platform that would combine financial rigor with 
    intuitive design.
    
    In our first year, we focused on helping finance students master valuation concepts. 
    Soon, startup founders and small business investors discovered our platform and 
    began using it for their own needs. Today, ValuIt serves thousands of users, from 
    students to professional analysts, all with the same mission: to make valuation 
    accessible to everyone.
