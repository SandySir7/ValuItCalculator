💡 Final Project Prompt: ValuIt – Company Valuation Made Simple
🎯 Objective:
Create a user-friendly valuation platform where anyone—student or pro—can perform company valuations using proven financial techniques like DCF, Comps, Precedent Transactions, and more. The site will be smart, flexible, and easy to understand, with auto-filled data, freemium model, and professional mode for deeper analysis.
🧩 Core Valuation Methods:
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
Comparable Company Analysis (EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/Revenue)
Precedent Transactions
Asset-Based Valuation
LBO (Pro Mode Only)
Each method will be clearly explained with examples and visual output.
📝 User Input with Smart Defaults:
Company name or ticker
Industry (optional if auto-detected)
Growth projections (1–5 years)
Perpetual growth rate
Discount rate / WACC
Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income (manual or auto)
Debt and Cash
Exit multiples
Validation request toggle (option to review by professionals)
📌 If users leave inputs blank, the platform fetches delayed industry averages or uses default valuation rules.
